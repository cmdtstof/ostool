###Central metadata repository for unstructured data supports records and knowledge management for small and medium-sized organisations.

Ostool is a central metadata repository for unstructured data. The tool enables small and medium-sized organizations (SMO) to manage its business- and knowledge-related documents on a low-tech IT environment. The filing is synchronized with the Ostool. The necessary metadata for the information lifecycle management are kept in the Ostool and provide a Records Management. Completed cases / projects can be appraised and delivered to a long-term archive automatically.
The tool also supports the Records Manager when designing a process-oriented storage structure.
Ostool is in a very early state of development. Support, comments and suggestions are welcome. Please help to improve the tool.
